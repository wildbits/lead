                    <strong>Lead</strong> provides estimation of the minimum amount of weight to carry in a dive.
                    Although <strong>Lead</strong> aims at being accurate, it can't be perfect. <strong>Lead</strong> can't take into account all details of a real environment. <strong>Lead</strong> is likely not free from bugs. <strong>Lead</strong> indications `must never` take precedence over common sense or established weight guidelines. Finally, <strong>Lead</strong> does not free divers from doing buoyancy checks.
